Output file: Encode the values of the above three values in some way. E.G. E_0d8_A0d55_P9.off

TODO:

- Function to iterate over all of the above ranges (triple-nested for-loop)
    - read in original sealmaster.txt file, store values for duration of program
    - modify params as needed, and for each set write a new file (new name so as to maintain orig sealmaster.txt)
    - execute program with newly generated sealmaster.txt for specific number of iterations
    - store the output name and the value of the 3 params in list
    - when all iterations complete, output the name-value info as .csv
